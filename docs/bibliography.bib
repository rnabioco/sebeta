  abstract = "Normalization of single-cell RNA sequencing data is necessary to
              eliminate cell-specific biases prior to downstream analyses.
              However, this is not straightforward for noisy single-cell data
              where many counts are zero. We present a novel approach where
              expression values are summed across pools of cells, and the
              summed values are used for normalization. Pool-based size factors
              are then deconvolved to yield cell-based factors. Our
              deconvolution approach outperforms existing methods for accurate
              normalization of cell-specific biases in simulated data. Similar
              behavior is observed in real data, where deconvolution improves
              the relevance of results of downstream analyses.",
